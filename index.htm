<p>Republic Day honours the date, January 26, 1950, on which The Constitution of India came into effect by replacing the Government of India act (1935).

While India achieved independence from the British Raj in 1947 through the Indian Independence Act 1947, it wasn't until 1950 that we became a sovereign state. Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of India's constitution.</p>
<br>
<h2>History of the day</h2>
<p>The Indian Constitution was drafted by BR Ambedkar, also known as the Architect of Indian Constitution. 26 January was chosen as the date for Republic day because it was on this day in 1930 that the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress as opposed to the Dominion status that was offered by the Britishers.

As the Indian laws were based on a modified version of the British establishment called the Government of India Act 1935.

A Drafting Committee led by BR Ambedkar prepared a permanent constitution, which was submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947 and adopted on 26 November. However, it came into force on 26 January 1950.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>The day is important in the history of India because it is the day when Indian National Congress made the declaration of complete self-rule/total independence or Poorna Swaraj.

As the day defines and states the importance of the Indian constitution, it is celebrated across India with much fervour and enthusiasm.

The main celebrations of the day are held in the national capital, New Delhi before the President of India. A ceremonious parade is organised at the Rajpath to pay trinute to India and its diversity and rich cultural heritage. Besides the parade in Rajpath, Republic Day celebrations are oragised in every state of the country.

Award distribution is a major part of the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi.

The President of India distributes Padma Awards to the civilians of India on this day. These awards are given in three categories - Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, in decreasing order of importance.</p>
